ERNI Idea Board for Android
===========================

This is the ERNI Idea Board app for Android, developed during the Hack Sessions and the ERNI Development Day.

## Important note for new project members

The best way to get up and running is to download the latest stable version of Android Studio. Currently version 1.0.x.

Please install the latest platform tools and API 21 (Android Lollipop) from the SDK Manager.

It is not allowed to use Eclipse for this project. Mostly to save you headaches, but also because you will likely mess up everything for everyone else.
You have been warned ;-)
